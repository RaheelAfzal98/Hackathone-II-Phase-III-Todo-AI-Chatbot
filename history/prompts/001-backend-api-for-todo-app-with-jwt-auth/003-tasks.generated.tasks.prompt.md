# Backend API Tasks Generated

## Prompt Text

$ARGUMENTS

## Response Text

Successfully generated comprehensive task breakdown for the Backend API for Todo App with JWT Auth. The tasks.md file includes 87 specific, actionable tasks organized across 9 phases:

1. **Phase 1: Setup** (10 tasks) - Project initialization and dependency setup
2. **Phase 2: Foundational Components** (11 tasks) - Core infrastructure components
3. **Phase 3: User Story 1 - Secure Task Management API** (14 tasks) - Core CRUD functionality
4. **Phase 4: User Story 2 - JWT Token Validation and Authorization** (11 tasks) - Security implementation
5. **Phase 5: User Story 3 - Task Completion Toggle** (9 tasks) - Completion status functionality
6. **Phase 6: Error Handling & Response Consistency** (8 tasks) - Consistent error responses
7. **Phase 7: Middleware & Security Configuration** (7 tasks) - Security and performance
8. **Phase 8: Testing & Verification** (10 tasks) - Comprehensive testing
9. **Phase 9: Documentation & Polish** (9 tasks) - Final documentation and optimization

Each task follows the required checklist format with proper IDs, parallelization markers [P], user story labels [US1], [US2], [US3], and specific file paths. The tasks are organized by priority following the user stories from the specification, with dependencies properly noted.

The implementation strategy focuses on delivering an MVP with User Story 1 (Secure Task Management API) as the core functionality that can be independently tested and demonstrated.

## Outcome

The task breakdown is complete and ready for execution. All tasks are specific enough to be implemented by an LLM without additional context, with clear file paths and implementation details.

## Evaluation

The generated tasks successfully break down the backend API implementation into manageable, testable units aligned with the original specification. Each user story is represented as a separate phase with all necessary components to deliver complete functionality. Parallel execution opportunities are properly identified with [P] markers.
